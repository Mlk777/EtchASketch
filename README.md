# Project : Random Quote Machine

First of the three projects of intermediate front end developpement project section.

The goal was to build a random quote generator with the following user stories :
* `There's a button to generate a new random quote.`
* `There's a button to tweet out a quote.`

I decided to go on "Etch a sketch" design.

__Particularities :__
* Etch a sketch look alike.
* Spinning buttons.
* Calling API.
* Use of Typed.js.
* Timeout function.
* Jquery effect.

__Skills :__
* API.
* Javascript. 
* CSS (positionning, animation).
